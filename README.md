# GRlaw: Gutenberg-Richter Analysis of Seismic Data
The Gutenberg-Richter law is an empirical model that expresses the connection between the magnitude *M* and the number *N(M)* of earthquakes of at least that magnitude as *log N(M) = a - bM* for some constants *a* and *b* [1]. This repository contains some basic functions to estimate the parameters *a* (also known as the *productivity*) and the *b*-value. Such functions were written using Rcpp, an open-source library that facilitates the integration of R and C++.
